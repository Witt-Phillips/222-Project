To run the web app locally (I may deploy at somepoint later but all local for now):

* Make sure the venv is set up properly. Running these commands in the terminal (in the root directory of the repo!) should get you there:

source myvenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

* Command to run the project (from root dir of repo)

streamlit run analysis.py
